    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 box (14.1 oz) refrigerated Pillsbury™ Pie Crusts (2 Count), softened as directed on box</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>9 cups thinly sliced, peeled apples (9 medium)</li>
        <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
     </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 450°F. Remove pie crusts from pouches. On lightly floured surface, unroll and stack crusts one on top of the other. Roll to 17x12-inch rectangle. Fit crust into 15x10x1-inch pan, pressing into corners. Fold extra crust under, even with edges of pan.</li>
        <li>In small bowl, mix granulated sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt and lemon juice. Add apples, stirring to coat. Spoon apple mixture into crust-lined pan.</li>
        <li>Bake 33 to 38 minutes or until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly. Cool in pan on cooling rack 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>In small bowl, mix powdered sugar and milk until well blended. Drizzle over pie. Let stand until glaze is set, about 30 minutes.</li>
     </ol>
